    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will try to recommend new collaborations to researchers of the Machine Learning community. Our approach will follow the guidelines of collaborative filtering: “**If your past behavior/preferences were similar to some other user’s, your future behavior may be as well**”. As an example, imagine you like Rolling Stones, Beatles and Jimmy Hendrix. It turns out that most people that like the aforementioned artists, are also fans of Eric Clapton. Then, it is very likely that if you listen to Eric Clapton’s music, you will like it as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement a **collaborative filtering recommendation system** for suggesting new collaborations to Machine Learning researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A network as a graph**: A graph or network represents relationships among different entities (users of a social network, researchers, products, etc.). Those entities are represented as nodes and the relationships between them (friends on Facebook, co-authors of a research paper, products purchased together) as edges. When there is an edge between two nodes, x and y, we say that y is a neighbor (or friend) of x (and also - as the graphs we consider are undirected - x is also a neighbor of y).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representing a graph in Python**: A widely used library in Python, for representing graphs is [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/). You can read the documentation for more information on how to use this library."

    "- ”old edges.txt”: In this file, every line contains the names of two re- searchers that have co-authored a paper in one of the top Machine Learn- ing conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML) between 2010 and 2016.\n",
    "- ”new edges.txt”: In this file, every line contains the names of two re- searchers (from those existing in the above file) that formed a new (non- existing before) collaboration, in either 2017 and 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the first file in hand, you will answer the following question:\n",
    "“For author X, list some non-collaborators in order, starting with the best col- laborator recommendation and ending with the worst”. A non-friend is a user who is not X and is not a collaborator of X. Depending on the recommendation algorithm you are going to choose, the list may include all non-collaborators or some of them.\n",

    "The complexity of each of the proposed algorithms is something in the neighborhood of O(N^3) if N = # number of nodes, given that for each X, you have to iterate through each friend of X's friends and friend of each mutual friend of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a better algorithm, one might include a score that involves duplicate edges that are filtered out in the above algorithms. If author X and friend Z collaborated on multiple papers together, then mutual friends y may have a higher liklehood of working with X. This wouldn't introduce much complexity at all and could be used in conjuction with the scores presented in the previous algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect that could be involved is mutual friends of mutual friends. If author X has mutual friend y through Z, and friend y is also friends with the friend of another Z, then that can be value added to the score. This could be introduced with however many levels deep the developer wants to go, although introducing exponential complexity with each added level. Most likely this should also be added to the score in a inverted relation with the amount of levels deeper one goes such as. After some literature resarrch, this seems to be along the lines of the P-rank formula which is off the same complexity of SimRank which appearrs to be more or less the formula used in part c. \n",
    "\n",
    "A third aspect that could be invovled is adding directionality to the graph. By making the graph directed, we could diffrentiate between X working with Z and Z working with X. The difference would lie, if the data provided were provided as such, by who \"initiates\" the collaboration. If X \"recruits\" Z to work with them, they are more likely to be the ones to collaborate with friends of Z, y, then friends of another Z who chose to be the ones to collaborate with X. his could simply be incorporated by adding a multipler > 1 to the score added from X working with Z vs Z working with X. This aspect of the score would be contigent on the data being provided as such, so it may not be possible to incorporate depending on how the data is represented. This wouldn't technically add any efficieny problems, since at worst it doubles the size of N from using an undirected graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also scale the score of each non-friend y by the number of friends they have, somewhat utilizing intuition behind the Google's PageRank algorithm. For a given non-friend y, there score may be scaled by the number of friends they have. Intuitively, if a non-friend y has many friends, they may be considered more important and therefore more likely to eventually work with author X. Again, this does not add much complexity or inefficiencies to the already existing metrics being used in previous problems."
