### Files:

**hw0.ipynb** contains code solutions to all problems as a Jupyter notebook  
- Main functions can be found commented out after the problems they correspond to and all functions can be tested by uncommented lines within them

**debugger.py** simply contains the notebook as a python script (note: may not be updated to reflect current solution in hw0.ipynb)

**data** contains datasets used for the problems
